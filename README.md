## About PSP Net Party

PSP NetParty (PNP) is like XLink Kai and adhocparty (ps3).
Adhoc Tunneling software that enables PSP communication play via the Internet. 

As of now, it is usable but with some minor issues such as not being able to follow ssid's on linux.
There are also some translating mistakes where eclipse automatically made a new line when I pasted the english text, which messed up the ui. Will fix if there's any interest.

There is no server being hosted for this program yet, that will change if this project gets any traction. Pageboy.org is only for testing purposes right now.
